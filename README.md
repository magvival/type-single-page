# type-single-page

 ## The Variable font I used for this project was Roboto Flex which has 12 different axes The original mockup for the website was made in Figma application and went through different color combinations, text varaitions until I found which one worked the best. The structure of the website was made by slight css grid and positioning tags such as top, bottom, left, and right. A huge thing I learned was that you can create classes for specific text tags or image tags which helped so much! One thing, I definitely experienced was that trying to position/overlap text to have it to fit to size is extremely hard. This being my first webpage I still have things to fix up and more code that helps the optimization of my website. Regardless I enjoyed created this project from start top finish!
